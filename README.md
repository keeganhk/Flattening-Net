# Flattening-Net: Deep Regular 2D Representation for 3D Point Cloud Analysis

This is the official implementation of **[[Flattening-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08892.pdf)] (TPAMI 2023)**, an unsupervised deep neural architecture to represent irregular 3D point clouds of arbitrary geometry and topology as a completely regular 2D point geometry image (PGI) structure, in which the coordinates of spatial points are captured in colors of image pixels. This code has been tested with Python 3.9, PyTorch 1.10.1, CUDA 11.1 and cuDNN 8.0.5 on Ubuntu 20.04.
